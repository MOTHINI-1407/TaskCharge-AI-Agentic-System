# TaskCharge AI — Agentic Automation System  
### 🚀 Google GenAI Capstone Project (2024–25)

TaskCharge AI is an end-to-end **agentic automation system** designed as part of the **Google Generative AI Capstone Project**.  
It uses modern LLM capabilities — **reasoning, memory, retrieval, tool calling, and workflow automation** — to execute tasks intelligently and independently.

This repository contains the full Kaggle notebook, architecture explanation, and implementation details of the project.
